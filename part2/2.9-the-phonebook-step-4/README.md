# 2.9*: The Phonebook Step4

Implement a search field that can be used to filter the list of people by name:

![App view](./images/app-view.png)

You can implement the search field as an input element that is placed outside the HTML form.
The filtering logic shown in the image is case insensitive,
meaning that the search term arto also returns results that contain Arto with an uppercase A.

NB: When you are working on new functionality,
it's often useful to "hardcode" some dummy data into your application, e.g.

```js
const App = () => {
  const [persons, setPersons] = useState([
    { name: 'Arto Hellas', number: '040-123456', id: 1 },
    { name: 'Ada Lovelace', number: '39-44-5323523', id: 2 },
    { name: 'Dan Abramov', number: '12-43-234345', id: 3 },
    { name: 'Mary Poppendieck', number: '39-23-6423122', id: 4 }
  ])

  // ...
}
```

This saves you from having to manually input data into your application
for testing out your new functionality.
