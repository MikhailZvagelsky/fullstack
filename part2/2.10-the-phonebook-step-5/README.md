# 2.10: The Phonebook Step5

If you have implemented your application in a single component,
refactor it by extracting suitable parts into new components.
Maintain the application's state and all event handlers in the App root component.

It is sufficient to extract three components from the application.
Good candidates for separate components are, for example,
the search filter,
the form for adding new people to the phonebook,
a component that renders all people from the phonebook,
and a component that renders a single person's details.

The application's root component could look similar to this after the refactoring.
The refactored root component below only renders titles and lets the extracted
components take care of the rest.

```js
const App = () => {
  // ...

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Phonebook</h2>

      <Filter ... />

      <h3>Add a new</h3>

      <PersonForm 
        ...
      />

      <h3>Numbers</h3>

      <Persons ... />
    </div>
  )
}
```

NB: You might run into problems in this exercise if you define your components "in the wrong place".
Now would be a good time to rehearse the chapter do not define a component
in another component from the last part.
